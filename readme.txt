Hello,

This project was created using VS2017.  Please download all the files and create the project locally.  The file I would like you to update is DispatchInstructor.aspx.  As a point of reference please look at Plane.aspx, the general look and feel should closely resemble this.  Specifically all <table> htmls tags need to be removed and replaced with <div> tags unless it doesn’t make sense.  The control lblMessage will need to be updated along with the command buttons, Save, Cancel, etc.  Again, please reference Plane.aspx, there examples of it all there.  Once your finished please upload the file and send me a message so I can review.

Thank you,

Tony
